        <p class="lead">The premier phytochemical database, phytochemdb.com, represents an authentic
            repository site for plant-derived phytochemicals that can ameliorate Computer-Aided Drug Design, Lead
            Optimization, Virtual Screening, and Molecular Docking as well as in the bioinformatics sector.
            <br>
            Currently, {{ n_plants }} plants from the Asian territory and their corresponding {{ n_compounds }}
            phytochemicals are available in this database that will escalate promptly.
            <br>
            This database assembles the Molecular Formula, 3D structure, Canonical SMILES, Molecular Weight, Hydrogen
            Bond Acceptor Count, Hydrogen Bond Donor Count, Molar Refractivity, Topological polar surface area (TPSA),
            WlogP, and Lipinski rule of five with the number of violations for each compound.
            <br>
            Anyone can inquiry about phytochemicals by the unique accession number, Canonical SMILES, Molecular formula,
            and plant names as well. Phytochemicals obtained from each plant can be found all together by simply
            searching the name of the plant.
            <br>
            This plant-derived phytochemical database will be immensely efficient for the researchers, professors, and
            learners of bioinformatics who are inquisitive at computer-aided Drug Designing, Lead Optimization, Visual
            Screening, and Molecular Docking.
            <br>
            Researchers who have screened phytochemicals in their laboratory and already published their data can
            contribute to this database. They can upload the three-dimensional structure of the phytochemicals in this
            database and the new uploaded compound will get a unique accession number after passing the review
            procedure.
            <br>

            will need to create a free account first.
